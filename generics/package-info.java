package generics;
//Generics is a concept in Java where you can enable a class, interface and, method, accept all (reference) types as parameters. In other words it is the concept which enables the users to choose the reference type that a method, constructor of a class accepts, dynamically.
//By defining a class generic you are making it type-safe i.e. it can act up on any datatype.
