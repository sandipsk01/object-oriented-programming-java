package Interface;
//java doesn't support multiple inheritance but it can be achieved by implements Interfaces
//class can only extend one class but can implement more than one Interface
//public class Car extends Vehicle implement Interface2, Interface2 
// Two interfaces can have same method but can not have same variable while implementing by same class
